## Introduction<a name="section11660541593"></a>

OpenHarmony LiteOS-M is a lightweight operating system kernel designed for the Internet of Things (IoT) field. It features small footprint, low power consumption, and high performance. It has a simple code structure, including the minimum kernel function set, kernel abstraction layer, optional components, and project directory. The LiteOS-M kernel is divided into the hardware layer and hardware-irrelevant layers. The hardware layer provides a unified hardware abstraction layer (HAL) interface for easier hardware adaptation. A range of compilation toolchains can be used with different chip architectures to meet the expansion of diversified hardware and compilation toolchains in the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) field.
**Figure1** shows the architecture of the LiteOS-M kernel.

## Constraints<a name="section119744591305"></a>

OpenHarmony LiteOS-M supports only C and C++.

It applies only to Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7, and RISC-V chip architectures.

## Usage<a name="section3732185231214"></a>

The OpenHarmony LiteOS-M kernel build system is a modular build system based on Generate Ninja (GN) and Ninja. It supports module-based configuration, tailoring, and assembling, and helps you build custom products. This document describes how to build a LiteOS-M project based on GN and Ninja. For details about the methods such as GCC+Makefile, IAR, and Keil MDK, visit the community websites.

### Setting Up the Environment

Before setting up the environment for a development board, you must set up the basic system environment for OpenHarmony first. The basic system environment includes the OpenHarmony build environment and development environment. For details, see [Setting Up Ubuntu Development Environment](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/HEAD/en/device-dev/quick-start/quickstart-lite-env-setup-linux.md). You need to install Python3.7+, GN, Ninja, and hb. For the LiteOS-M kernel, you also need to install the Make build tool and [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).

### Obtaining the OpenHarmony Source Code

Obtain the latest OpenHarmony source code through Git clone on a Linux server. For details about how to obtain the source code, see [Source Code Acquisition](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/HEAD/en/device-dev/quick-start/quickstart-lite-env-setup-linux.md). This document assumes that the clone directory is `~/openHarmony` after the complete OpenHarmony repository code is obtained.

### Obtaining the Source Code of the Sample Project

The following uses the development board Nucleo-F767Zi as an example to describe how to build and run the `OpenHarmony LiteOS-M` kernel project. In the local directory, run the following command to clone the sample code:

```
git clone https://gitee.com/harylee/nucleo_f767zi.git
```

The code is cloned to **~/nucleo_f767zi**. Run the following commands to copy the **device** and **vendor** directories in the code directory to the corresponding directories of the **openHarmony** project:

```
mkdir ~/openHarmony/device/st

cp -r ~/nucleo_f767zi/device/st/nucleo_f767zi ~/openHarmony/device/st/nucleo_f767zi

chmod +x ~/openHarmony/device/st/nucleo_f767zi/build.sh

cp -r ~/nucleo_f767zi/vendor/st ~/openHarmony/vendor/st
```

For details about the directory of the sample code, see [Board-Level Directory Specifications](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/HEAD/en/device-dev/porting/porting-chip-board-overview.md). If you need to port the development board, see [Board-Level OS Porting](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/HEAD/en/device-dev/porting/porting-chip-board.md).

### Building and Running

Before the build, configure the **bin** directory of the cross compilation toolchain in the **PATH** environment variable or set **board&#95;toolchain&#95;path** in the **device/st/nucleo&#95;f767zi/liteos&#95;m/config.gni** file to the **bin** directory of the cross compilation toolchain.
In the **OpenHarmony** root directory, run the **hb set** command to set the product path, select **nucleo_f767zi**, and run the **hb build** command to start the build. Example:

```
user@dev:~/OpenHarmony$ hb set

[OHOS INFO] Input code path: # Press Enter and select nucleo_f767zi.

OHOS Which product do you need? nucleo_f767zi@st

user@dev:~/OpenHarmony$ hb build
```

The image is generated in the **~/openHarmony/out/nucleo&#95;f767zi/** directory. You can download the image file to the board by using the STM32 ST-LINK Utility software and run the image.

### Community Porting Project Links
